### About Gazali Agboola

I’m **Gazali Agboola**, a **Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer** with experience spanning **commercial analytics, credit risk, customer behavior modeling, and AI-driven decision systems**. My work sits at the intersection of **machine learning, data engineering, and applied AI**, with a strong emphasis on turning complex data into **scalable, production-ready solutions**.

I hold **Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Mathematics**, and I am currently completing a **Ph.D. in Data Science & Analytics**. While my doctoral research focuses on machine learning and deep learning architectures for **risk detection, prediction, and monitoring**, my approach is firmly **industry-aligned**—prioritizing performance, interpretability, and deployment over theory.

I have applied data science in both **corporate and applied research environments**, including:

* **Commercial analytics and credit risk monitoring**, where I built dashboards, automated ETL pipelines, and risk models to improve forecasting accuracy, reduce overdue receivables, and accelerate executive decision-making 
* **AI engineering and ML product development**, including LLM-powered chatbots, agentic AI systems, and real-time decision-support tools built with Python, SQL, cloud platforms, and modern ML frameworks 
* **Machine learning modeling**, covering supervised and unsupervised learning, deep learning (CNNs, Transformers), causal inference, and A/B testing for model validation and performance optimization

### What I Work On

My core interests and strengths include:

* **Machine learning & AI engineering** for scalable, real-world applications
* **Risk modeling and predictive analytics** (credit risk, fraud detection, operational risk)
* **End-to-end ML pipelines**, from data ingestion and feature engineering to model evaluation and deployment
* **LLM integration and agentic systems**, especially for decision support and user-facing analytics tools
* **Data visualization and storytelling**, translating technical results into insights stakeholders can act on

While my research background includes geospatial and disaster-risk applications, the underlying skills—**modeling, experimentation, optimization, and deployment**—are directly transferable to **finance, retail, technology, and enterprise analytics** environments.

### How I Think About Data Science

I approach data science as a **product discipline**, not just modeling:

* Start with the **business or operational problem**
* Build **robust, explainable models**
* Validate with **metrics that matter**
* Deliver insights through **dashboards, APIs, or decision tools**
* Iterate based on feedback and real-world performance

I enjoy working in **cross-functional teams**, collaborating with engineers, analysts, and business stakeholders to move ideas from prototype to production.
